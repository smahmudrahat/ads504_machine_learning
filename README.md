A GitHub repository for the project on image classification and price prediction using deep learning models trained on Fashion-MNIST and AliExpress datasets._


# Image Recognition for AliExpress Price Prediction

This repository contains the implementation of an image classification and price prediction model using deep learning. The project builds upon Fashion-MNIST and real-world AliExpress data to develop robust AI models.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Image classification using CNNs and ANNs
- NLP-based price prediction using product titles
- Data collection via web scraping (Playwright)
- Model evaluation and optimization

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
Refer to the repository structure for details on dataset, models, and scripts.

## ðŸ”§ Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Image-Recognition-AliExpress.git
cd Image-Recognition-AliExpress
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸ“Š Results
The CNN model trained on AliExpress data achieved up to **35% accuracy** on Fashion-MNIST validation. NLP price prediction RMSE: **1.33**.

## ðŸ”® Future Work
- Increase dataset size and improve image diversity
- Implement transfer learning for improved accuracy
- Optimize model efficiency for real-time applications
